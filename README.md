## A HEURISTIC APPROACH TO SOFTWARE COST ESTIMATION USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES

In the context of software development, accurate cost estimation is crucial for efficient resource allocation and project management. 

This project aims to address the challenges of traditional estimation methods by leveraging deep learning techniques for software cost estimation. Using data from the **International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG)**, we develop a multi-organizational model based on various neural network architectures. Through rigorous validation using metrics like RMSE and MAE, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately predicting software project costs. The study concludes that deep learning models offer improved estimation accuracy compared to traditional methods, providing valuable insights for project managers and developers.
